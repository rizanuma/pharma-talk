# Project Name: PHARMA TALK

# Project Purpose: 
To address the growing demand for accessible healthcare information and improve the way users access and understand drug-related information.

# Project Objective: 
Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic search to provide a user-friendly and intelligent interface for accessing accurate, timely, and relevant drug information.

# KEY FEATURES
Semantic Search: Enhancing drug information retrieval throughsemantic search.
Conceptual Similarity: Improving understanding by capturing the relationships between drugs and their attributes.
Drug Interaction Checker: Assisting healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public in assessing drug interactions.

# PROJECT SCOPE
Pharma Talk  will focus on providing information and services related to a comprehensive list of pharmaceutical drugs. This includes prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal supplements. The coverage will extend to a wide range of drug categories, such as antibiotics, pain relievers, cardiovascular medications, and more.

# TARGET USERS
General Public: Individuals who are looking for information about common drugs, including potential side effects, usage guidelines, and precautions.
Healthcare Professionals: This includes doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other medical practitioners who require accurate and up-to-date drug information for their practice.
Researchers: Pharmaceutical researchers and academics seeking information on drug properties, interactions, and usage.

# LIMITATIONS
•	Data Limitation: The quality and comprehensiveness of the drug information are dependent on the availability and accuracy of the data sources.
•	Regulatory Compliance: The system should adhere to relevant regulatory and privacy requirements, such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), to ensure the security and confidentiality of user data.
